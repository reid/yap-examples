# YAP Examples

You'll find some nifty [Yahoo! Application Platform][YAP] app examples here. New examples will be added from time to time.

Currently focusing on:

* [YML][], a language for easily adding dynamic and per-user content to your app
* [YUI 2][], an awesome JavaScript library that's compatible with YAP's cajoled scripting environment

Enjoy!
